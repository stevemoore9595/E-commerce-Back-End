# E-commerce-Back-End

## Description

Adding this back end app to my business so that I can compete with high-end e-commerce companies. This will bring more customer business to buy my products and they don't have to come into a store to shop. They can sit back and relax on the couch to shop online, especially if there is bad weather.
